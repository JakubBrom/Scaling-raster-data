## Istallation
You need QGIS, version 2.x and active Processing toolbox. Copy script files into the Scripts folder (see Processing/Options/Scripts/Scripts folder). It is also possible installing script from Processing tools panel: Scripts/Tools/Add script from file. The second way is easier however only script without help is installed.
